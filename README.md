## üîß Placeholders (PlaceholderAPI)

MineVote provides several placeholders to display vote boost information on your server using PlaceholderAPI.

| Placeholder              | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `%minevote_counter%`     | Total number of votes counted during the boost.                            |
| `%minevote_objective%`   | Vote goal set in the configuration.                                        |
| `%minevote_status%`      | Boost status: displays a message indicating whether the boost is active.   |
| `%minevote_timeleft%`    | Remaining boost time in `mm:ss` format, or a clock icon if it has ended.   |

### How to use?

2. Integrate these placeholders into your messages, signs, or commands that support PlaceholderAPI.
